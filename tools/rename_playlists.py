Script to rename existing playlists to the new format

This script helps you rename your existing Spotify playlists to match
your bot's naming convention. It's useful when you want to standardize
playlist names across your account.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES:
- Understand API operations for playlist management
- Learn about HTTP PUT requests for updates
- Practice working with JSON data in API calls
- Understand playlist naming conventions
- Learn about batch operations and error handling
