Preseed Playlists Script
Fill all playlists with their target amounts of tracks

This script helps you quickly populate all your playlists with tracks
by running the update commands for each playlist type. It's useful
when you first set up the bot or want to fill empty playlists.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES:
- Understand batch operations and automation
- Learn about system command execution
- Practice working with multiple playlist types
- Understand error handling in batch processes
- Learn about using Makefile commands programmatically
